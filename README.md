<h2>Description</h2>
Project Description
The Predictive Analytics for Road Safety project aims to develop a robust predictive model that identifies key contributing factors and risk factors associated with car accidents. Utilizing a comprehensive car accident dataset, the project seeks to uncover patterns and insights that can inform strategies to reduce accident rates and enhance road safety. By analyzing variables such as driver behavior, environmental conditions, vehicle characteristics, and road infrastructure, the model will provide actionable recommendations for stakeholders in the automotive and transportation sectors.
